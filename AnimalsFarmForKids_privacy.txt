## 2. Information Collection and Use

The app **does not collect or store any personal data** such as name, email, or phone number.  
No user registration, login, or account creation is required.

- operating system version,  
- app version,  
- IP address (used temporarily by ad servers to determine the country of access),  
- language and region settings,  
- anonymous ad performance statistics (e.g., impressions, clicks).

This information is processed in an **aggregated and anonymous form** and is **not used for profiling or personalized advertising**.

The app does **not** collect or use precise location (GPS), camera, microphone, contacts, or any files from the device.
